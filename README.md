## List of React Fundamental Concepts used in my project

- JSX (JavaScript XML) - A syntax extension for JavaScript that allows embedding HTML within JavaScript, making code more readable and intuitive.

- Components - The building blocks of a React application. Components can be functional or class-based, reusable, and modular.

- State - A built-in object that manages data within a component. State changes trigger re-renders, updating the UI accordingly.

- Event Handling - Reactâ€™s way of managing events such as clicks, form submissions, or keyboard input, often using inline functions or callback references.

-Conditional Rendering - Logic that allows components to render differently based on certain conditions, typically using ternary operators or && syntax.

- Lists and Keys - For rendering lists of elements, keys provide a unique identifier for each element to improve performance and maintain stability.

- Context API - A way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level, useful for global data like themes or user authentication.

- Hooks - Functions like useState, useEffect, useContext, etc., that allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features without classes.
